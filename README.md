# DataMining
#实现Apriori algorithm 和 FP-Growth algorithm，使用python，数据使用见下编号2

1.Implemented the Apriori algorithm and the FP-Growth algorithm for frequent itemset mining.

2.Generate synthetic datasets using the IBM Synthetic Data Generator for Itemsets and Sequences
available at https://github.com/zakimjz/IBMGenerator.

3.Test the impact of the following parameters on the performance (e.g., running time and memory
comsumption) of the algorithms.
 The minimum support threshold minsup
 The number of transactions
 The length of transactions
 The number of distinct items


4.Test the running time taken by each major procedure of the algorithms, for example, candidate
generation, candidate pruning, and support counting of the Apriori algorithm.
